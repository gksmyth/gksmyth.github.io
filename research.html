<h2>Bioinformatics Research</h2>
<p>My research group is based in the <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/about-structure/scientific-divisions/bioinformatics">
Bioinformatics Division</a> of The <a href="http://www.wehi.edu.au">Walter
and Eliza Hall Institute</a> for Medical Research in Melbourne. See the
<a href="http://www.wehi.edu.au/faculty_members/professor_gordon_smyth">Smyth Lab
Homepage</a> for a description of our research focus, a list of lab members and
key publications. The WEHI Bioinformatics Division also maintains
its own domain at <a href="https://bioinf.wehi.edu.au">https://bioinf.wehi.edu.au</a> which
provides software tools and other resources and useful information.</p>
<p>My research is in statistical bioinformatics, and specifically in genomic experiments
to understand gene expression and gene regulation.
My group creates statistical methods to analyse data arising from
microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq experiments.
This includes a range of algorithmic and statistical techniques ranging from low-level issues
such as pre-processing and data quality
right through to the analysis of higher order patterns such molecular pathway signatures
and systems biology.
My group collaborates with many biomedical scientists at the WEHI and elsewhere on
a range of human diseases including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple sclerosis and various immunological disorders.</p>
