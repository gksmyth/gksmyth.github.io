<h1>Experiences in Training Students in<br>
Statistical Consulting and Data Analysis</h1>

University of Queensland, St Lucia, Q 4072, Australia</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper describes some of my experiences teaching consulting and data analysis at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, and at The University of Queensland,
Australia. Both universities have formal data analysis courses. At the University of
California however there is also an organized consulting service, the &quot;StatLab&quot;,
directed by a faculty member and staffed by graduate students. The graduate students
discharge their Teaching Assistant obligations by consulting under the supervision of the
Director. The aims of the StatLab are (1) to give graduate students experience in
consulting, (2) to provide statistical assistance to researchers and graduate students on
campus, and (3) to provide a commercial consulting service to the general community. At
The University of Queensland, graduate students are drastically more scarce, and there is
no consulting laboratory along the above lines. It is still possible, though, to give a
small number of the better interested students experience in consulting through Research
Assistantships, Vacation Scholarships and Honours projects.</p>

<p>How we teach consulting depends of course on how we see the consulting process itself.
I find it useful to emphasize four distinct steps: (1) defining the problem, (2) initial
examination of the data using tables and graphs, (3) more formal analysis as appropriate
using parametric models and statistical tests, and (4) presenting conclusions. I often ask
students in my data analysis courses to write reports in four sections corresponding to
the above four steps. Most of the following discussion is organized under the same
headings.</p>

<p>This paper is based entirely on my own experience. Other accounts of the consulting
process are contained in Boen and Zahn (1982) and Hand and Everitt (1987), and in the
references therein. Other accounts of teaching consulting are given in Rustagi and Wolfe
(1982).</p>

<h2>2. Defining the Problem</h2>

<h3>2.1 Interviewing the Client</h3>

<p>Most students are surprised to discover how long it takes to grasp what a client's
problem is all about. A consultation with a new client seldom takes less than an hour, and
most of that time is spent uncovering the real nature of the problem. Clients, through
long familiarity with their study, often take for granted and fail to mention details
which are highly significant and unexpected to the statistician. In ongoing collaborative
projects, features of the physical problem may keep coming to light months after
discussion has begun.</p>

<p>It is important to have the client describe the experiment in concrete terms. One of
the questions that I ask most often is &quot;what does &quot;x&quot; physically mean, what
are you actually measuring?&quot; Clients occasionally feel that they can save time for
the statistician by giving him or her only a simplified abstraction of the real problem.
Or they feel insecure about discussing the prosaic details of their experiment with a
mathematician, and so hide them behind a mathematical pseudo-problem. </p>

<p>Clients are seldom accustomed to speaking in mathematical terms, nor are statisticians
usually familiar with the jargon of the client's specialty. I believe that the onus is on
the statistician to talk in the client's language. I usually find it useful to talk about
&quot;chi-squared statistics&quot; rather than &quot;deviances&quot; or &quot;likelihood
ratio tests&quot;, and perhaps &quot;variability&quot; or &quot;standard error
rather&quot; than &quot;variance&quot;. More deeply, as one tries to assimilate the
concrete problem, one tries to talk to the client in those concrete terms, and to draw all
conclusions back to those terms.</p>

<p>To teach good &quot;desk side manner&quot; one must involve students in actual
consulting sessions. In Santa Barbara I tried to involve at least one student in each
consultation, actively if possible but passively if necessary. In Queensland, students can
sometimes have a lot of contact with a client when involved on a collaborative project.</p>

<h3>2.2 Identifying the Questions of Interest</h3>

<p>I feel that accurately identifying the basic questions of interest is the most
fundamental issue of consulting or data analysis, and I emphasize it accordingly to
students. I often ask clients early in a consultation &quot;What is the basic question you
are trying to answer with this data set.&quot; or, less directly, &quot;How will you use
the estimates from this model&quot;. The precision with which this question can be
answered determines in good part how successful the consultation will be. It can be quite
different to ask &quot;Is treatment A better than the rest?&quot; instead of &quot;Which
treatment is the best?&quot; One needs to know whether the analysis is exploratory or
confirmatory, which variables are blocking factors or covariates, and which are the
variables of interest, which is the response, random or fixed effect, and so on.</p>

<p>In an academic environment, most analyses are primarily exploratory. This affects the
choice of test size (if one is testing hypotheses) and formality of analysis in general.
It is useful to emphasize this to students, since it gives them the confidence to loosen
up their common sense -- for example, to observe that &quot;the data suggests&quot; such
and such, instead of simply giving a list of which contrasts are significant at the
prescribed level. </p>

<h2>3. Displaying and Describing the Data</h2>

<p>Most students want to push the data, without looking at it, straight into whatever the
obvious parametric procedure is. I learnt myself only through the hard experience of
having to re-do the parametric calculations, that it really does pay to begin a data
analysis with thoughtful data display and description. Apart from the fact that the data
description may settle by itself the questions of interest to everybody's satisfaction, it
will make evident all sorts of salient features of the data which may be hidden in a
parametric analysis with its low dimensional focus. It will make clear what the focus of
the formal analysis should be, and how much trust can be placed in it.</p>

<p>Data description also allows one to assess the quality of the database. Medium or large
data sets are usually full of gross errors that can be made obvious with appropriate
displays and often corrected. Unfortunately, only compulsive obsessive personalities seem
to take readily to this task. During my time as Statlab director, I was constantly
reminded of my failure to persuade students of the importance of checking the data.</p>

<p>Data display has been almost entirely absent from traditional mathematical statistics
courses. At both Santa Barbara and Queensland, students see it for the first time in the
data analysis course just before they graduate. Hopefully this will change soon with the
modern movement to make statistics courses data driven from an early stage.</p>

<h2>4. Formal Analysis</h2>

<p>Having made an initial study of the data, one will want, data willing, to fit a formal
parametric statistical model. This allows one to fine-tune estimators and to be
quantitative about the surety with which inferences are made. A good consultant uses
whatever methodologies are required by the data and the questions to be addressed, not
necessarily those suggested by his or her research pre-occupations. Students therefore
need an wide overview of what techniques are available, and an understanding of when they
are applicable. As a practical matter, one is generally restricted to techniques that are
easily available in statistical packages or very simply programmed.</p>

<p>Not all data sets are suited formal analyses, and this is a useful lesson in itself.
When there is too much data, or too little, or the assumptions are too unclear, it may be
best to stop with the data display. A related lesson, when one does perform a parametric
analysis, is that simple and interpretable models are best.</p>

<p>At the stage that I see students -- towards the end of their undergraduate degree in
Queensland, or towards the end of their graduate program in California -- they know
something about normal theory analysis of variance and multiple regression and, perhaps,
multivariate analysis. They don't know how to apply these methodologies, for example to
choose the best model out of several covariates in a multiple regression or to decide when
an ANOVA has a random rather than a fixed effect. They certainly don't know anything about
unbalanced designs, residual analysis, simultaneous inference, or any sort of non-normal
analysis including categorical analysis. I have found it necessary to teach many
statistical methodologies, especially logistic regression and log-linear analysis, to
students at the same time as introducing data sets to which they are applicable.
Categorical, especially dichotomous, data is so common that it seems indefensible to send
students out as statistics graduates who know nothing about its analysis.</p>

<p>Having settled on a parametric model, one will further test its assumptions by
examining the residuals. Residual analysis is now very well established, and students
accept it very easily. </p>

<h2>5. Presenting the Conclusions</h2>

<p>The conclusions of an analysis must be presented in the concrete terms of the physical
problem, not in the terminology of mathematical statistics. If the question was &quot;is
detergent A better than detergent B&quot;, the answer is not &quot;factor DET is
significant at the 1% level&quot;, which is what students write until they have gained
confidence with the idea of using ordinary language. The conclusions will be supported by
plots or tables, either of the parameters of the formal model or, more often, the
corresponding data display. </p>

<p>The presentation of conclusions emphasizes Fisher's principle of data summary. Data
summary is the basic process of data analysis, i.e. summarizing what the data has to say
about the questions of interest. Tables and descriptive statistics summarize data in a
obvious way. Parametric models provide the ultimate reduction of data into a finite number
of parameter estimates. I teach students that the complexity of the model determines the
complexity of the data summary. If an additive ANOVA model fits, then one way tables of
means for each factor are an adequate final presentation. If interactions are present, one
needs two way or higher tables. This is in a sense the meaning of (fixed effect) ANOVA, to
determine the complexity of the tables necessary to describe the salient features of the
data. Log-linear analysis of contingency tables is exactly analogous, with relative
frequencies replacing means.</p>

<h2>6. Course Structure</h2>

<p>In formal courses I hand out data sets, with a couple of paragraphs describing the
background and purpose of the study, and have the students prepare written reports of
their analyses. I encourage them to address their report to the experimenter. Student
reactions range from &quot;collating computer output is boring&quot; to &quot;This is
great, it [statistical theory] all comes together at last.&quot; In the StatLab, students
work on &quot;live&quot; consulting problems. They spend a majority of their time
performing the calculations for steps two and three of the analysis using statistical
packages, but are also involved in the initial interviews and the final report writing. </p>

<p>When choosing data sets for data analysis courses, I try to avoid problems which are
too large and complicated, too full of missing data, or too nonstandard, to be done
justice to in a reasonable time at the level of the course. Usually also I avoid data sets
which don't lend themselves to a formal analysis.</p>

<p>I have found it valuable to have a regular weekly meeting with the consulting students,
usually for one hour at the same time each week. We meet even if there has been no
particular new development during the week. This avoids the project which gets
&quot;lost&quot; for a month or so. It also encourages students to show me partly
completed work, giving me the opportunity to pick up problems at an early stage,
encourages the students to ask questions, and provides regular non-traumatic deadlines.</p>

<h2>7. Software and Hardware</h2>

<p>Where possible, StatLab tries to help a client to perform his or her own analysis
rather than taking over the data. This promotes statistical education and conserves the
consultant's time, which seems very scarce compared with the volume of data requiring
analysis! This approach, of course, determines both hardware and software -- one uses what
the client has -- and requires the consultant to acquire some knowledge of a very wide
variety of software.</p>

<p>One takes over an analysis if the calculations are nonstandard or too difficult, or if
the client is paying! The diverse strengths of the different software packages have
encouraged us to take an eclectic approach. In the StatLab, we used mainly Systat,
followed by SAS, GLIM, S-Plus, Gauss and occasionally SPSS. We used mainly PCs, sometimes
Sun workstations (S-Plus) or an IBM mainframe (SAS with large data sets). When teaching
the consulting course in Santa Barbara, I allowed students to use their own preferred
packages. They responded with SAS, Systat, GLIM, Statistix, BMDP and S-Plus, in roughly
that order.</p>

<p>In Queensland, we teach with a combination of Minitab and GLIM on a Unix super-mini
computer. When supervising students on collaborative projects, I have used GLIM, followed
by Minitab, S, Gauss and PLUM, mainly on the super-mini but sometimes on a PC or Sun
workstation. </p>

<h2>8. Commercial Versus Academic Consulting</h2>

<p>In Santa Barbara about a third of the total consulting effort of the StatLab is for off
campus clients, for which payment is requested. Commercial consulting broadens the range
of problems that academics and students are exposed to. If well done, it promotes the
university and the discipline of statistics in the community, and makes it easier to place
graduates. The income earned provides jobs for graduates and financial flexibility for the
host department.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of commercial consulting is the over-riding need for
timeliness, and this can be difficult to achieve when supervising students who are
learning as they go. Commercial consulting is often quite tedious, perhaps involving very
low level analysis of a large body of data. An occasional problem is the paying customer
who believes he is buying a service, like dry cleaning, to which his data can be subjected
to without any thought on his own part. (A more accurate simile is that statistical
consultants are like therapists: we help clients to think more clearly about and to solve
their own problems.) Most clients though are well aware of the value for money that they
receive from the university service.</p>

<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>

<p>I don't think there is any question that teaching consulting is worthwhile and
rewarding. Consulting and data analysis require many skills not taught in theoretical
courses. For students who are not planning to become mathematical researchers, consulting
and data analysis amount to the actual practice of their craft &#150; theoretical studies
are just background. To understand how to go about it, students need exposure to real
data, and this should begin sufficiently early in their courses for them to absorb the
lessons it brings. Consideration of complete problems, from a client's point of view,
provides students with a coherent overview of statistics, bringing together and
demonstrating the purpose of otherwise unmotivated results.</p>
