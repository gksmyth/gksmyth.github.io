<h1>Australian - American Dictionary</h1>

<hr>

<p>Notes: Australian and American english are not static of course, and most American
usages are making rapid inroads into Australian usage through the influence of media such
as television and films and through the Australian usage of American products such as
computers. Meanwhile Australian words are increasingly understood in the US. Also American
usage varies substantially across the country. This list mainly reflects my experience in
California in 1985-88. In many cases where direct translation was impossible I have often
picked some American counterpart that seemed to be in the same spirit. Hence <em>scone</em>
to <em>biscuit</em>, <em>bubble and squeak</em> to <em>hash browns</em>, <em>mate</em> to <em>sidekick</em>.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>bedsit (Oz) = studio apartment (US)</strong> <em>n</em></dt>
  <dd>An apartment with kitchen/living room and bathroom, but no separate bedroom. The US
    version can be very comfortable (I had one in Goleta, California), while British-style
    bedsits are often very cramped. A British style bedsit would probably attract the
    description &quot;toy studio&quot; if found in the US. I noticed the term &quot;studio
    apartment&quot; in use in Australia (Brisbane) for the first time in 1992, in a real
    estate advertisement. Obviously it sounded more impressive than &quot;bedsit&quot;. In any
    case, this type of apartment is relatively uncommon in Australia.</dd>
  <dt><strong>continental quilt (Oz)</strong> <em>n</em></dt>
  <dd>See doona.</dd>
  <dt><strong>doona (Oz) = comforter (US)</strong> <em>n</em></dt>
  <dd>Quilted eiderdown with a down or synthetic filling. &quot;Doona&quot; is an Tradename.
    &quot;Doona&quot; is apparently used in Australia only, and is unknown in New Zealand and
    Britain, let alone the US.</dd>
