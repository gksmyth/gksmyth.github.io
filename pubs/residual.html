<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>In this paper we give a general definition of residuals for
regression models with independent responses. Our definition
produces residuals which are exactly normal, apart from sampling
variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted
distribution function for each response value and finding the
equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some
randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response
variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in
computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM or LispStat, and
allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly
occurring situations in which the customary definitions of
residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this paper to
three example data sets. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Residuals, and especially plots of residuals, play a central
role in the checking of statistical models. In normal linear
regression the residuals are normally distributed and can be
standardized to have equal variances. In non-normal regression
situations, such as logistic regression or log-linear analysis,
the residuals, as usually defined, may be so far from normality
and from having equal variances as to be of no practical use. A
particular problem occurs when the response variable is discrete
and takes on a small number of distinct values, as for Poisson
data with mean not far from zero or binomial data with mean close
to either zero or the number of trials. In such situations the
residuals lie on nearly parallel curves corresponding to distinct
response values, and these spurious curves distract the eye
seriously from any meaningful message that might be contained in
a residual plot. </p>

<p>In this paper we give a general definition of residuals for
regression models with independent responses. Our definition
produces residuals which are exactly normal, apart from sampling
variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted
distribution function at each response value and finding the
equivalent standard normal quantile. This approach is closely
related to that of Cox and Snell (1968), but whereas Cox and
Snell concentrate on mean and variance corrections we concentrate
on the transformation to normality. Our definition includes some
randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response
variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in
computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM or LispStat, and
allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly
occurring situations in which the customary definitions of
residuals fail. </p>

<p>Special cases of quantile residuals have been used by
Brillinger and Preisler (1983) and Brillinger (1996). For other
work on residuals for non-normal regression models see Pierce and
Schafer (1986) or McCullagh and Nelder (1989) and the references
therein. In the discussion at the end of the paper we briefly
indicate how quantile residuals may be extended to models with
dependent responses.</p>
