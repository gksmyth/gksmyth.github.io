<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Residual maximum likelihood estimation (REML) is often preferred to maximum likelihood
estimation as a method of estimating covariance parameters in linear models because it
takes account of the loss of degrees of freedom in estimating the mean and produces
unbiased estimating equations for the variance parameters. In this note it is shown that
REML has an exact conditional likelihood interpretation, where the conditioning is on an
appropriate sufficient statistic to remove dependence on the nuisance parameters. This
interpretation clarifies the motivation for REML and generalizes directly to non-normal
models in which there exists a low dimensional sufficient statistic for the fitted values.
The conditional likelihood is shown to be well defined and to satisfy the properties of a
likelihood function, even though this is not generally true when conditioning on
statistics which depend on parameters of interest. Using the conditional likelihood
representation, the concept of REML is extended to generalized linear models with varying
dispersion and canonical link. Explicit calculation of the conditional likelihood is given
for the oneway layout. A saddle-point approximation for the conditional likelihood is also
derived.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Patterson and Thompson&nbsp;(1971) introduced residual maximum likelihood estimation
(REML) as a method of estimating variance components in the context of unbalanced
incomplete block designs. REML is often preferred to maximum likelihood estimation because
it takes account of the loss of degrees of freedom in estimating the mean and produces
unbiased estimating equations for the variance parameters. Alternative and more general
derivations of REML are given by Harville&nbsp;(1974), Cooper &amp; Thompson&nbsp;(1977)
and Verbyla&nbsp;(1990). In all of these the residual likelihood is presented as the
marginal likelihood of the error constrasts. This makes generalization of the residual
likelihood principle to nonlinear models or non-normal distributions difficult since
zero-mean error contrasts do not generally exist. Cox and Reid&nbsp;(1987) give an
approximate conditional likelihood which reduces to REML when used to estimate covariance
parameters in normal linear models. Although Cox and Reid's conditional likelihood is
approximate, and is based on a simplification of Barndorff-Nielsen's (1983, 1985) modified
profile likelihood which reduces to REML only in special cases, it does suggest a
conditional interpretation for REML. In this paper we show that REML has an exact
conditional likelihood interpretation in which the conditioning is on an appropriate
sufficient statistic to remove dependence on the nuisance parameters. This interpretation
clarifies the motivation for REML and generalizes directly to non-normal models in which
there exists a low dimensional sufficient statistic for the fitted values.</p>

<p>Consider the linear model <em><b>y</b> = X <b>b</b> + <b>e</b></em> where <em><b>y</b></em>
is an <em>n x 1</em> vector of responses, <em>X</em> is an <em>n x p</em> design matrix of
full column rank and <em><b>e</b> ~ N(0,M)</em> is a random vector. The covariance matrix <em>M</em>
is a function of a <em>q</em>-dimensional parameter <em><b>g</b></em>, and is assumed
positive definite for <em><b>g</b></em> in a neighbourhood of the true value. For any
fixed value of <em><b>g</b></em>, the statistic <em><b>t</b>=AX<sup>T</sup>M<sup>-1</sup><b>y</b></em>,
where <em>A</em> is any nonsingular <em>p x p</em> matrix function of <em><b>g</b></em>,
is complete sufficient for <em><b>b</b></em>. We show that the residual likelihood can be
viewed as the conditional likelihood of <em><b>y</b></em> given <em><b>t</b></em>. We
show, given the above form for <em><b>t</b></em>, that the conditional likelihood is well
defined and satisfies the properties of a likelihood function, even though this not
generally true when conditioning on statistics which depend on parameters of interest.</p>

<p>Using the conditional likelihood representation, the concept of REML is extended to
generalized linear models with varying dispersion. We assume that <em>y<sub>1</sub>,...,y<sub>n</sub></em>
follow a generalized linear model with canonical link, design matrix <em>X</em> and
weights <em>w<sub>j</sub>/s<sub>j</sub></em>. The <em>w<sub>j</sub></em> are known prior
weights and the <em>s<sub>j</sub></em> are assumed to depend on <em><b>g</b></em>. The
REML estimator of <em><b>g</b></em> is defined to be that which maximizes the conditional
likelihood of <em><b>y</b></em> given <em><b>t</b>=AX<sup>T</sup>M<sup>-1</sup><b>y</b></em>
where in this case <em>M=</em>diag<em>(s<sub>j</sub>/w<sub>j</sub>)</em>. Explicit
calculation of the conditional likelihood is given for the oneway layout. A convenient
saddle-point approximation is derived for use in other cases.</p>

<p>The idea of conditioning to remove nuisance parameters goes back at least to Bartlett
(1936, 1937), and is discussed extensively by Kalbfleisch and Sprott&nbsp;(1970). Our
conditional likelihood is direct and differs from that suggested by Kalbfleisch and Sprott
and motivated by their ``Euclidean assumption''. The difficulties that the Euclidean
assumption was intended to overcome do not occur when the conditioning statistic is of the
form given above.</p>

<p>McCullagh and Tibshirani&nbsp;(1990) give an estimating equation method of adjusting
profile likelihoods for nuisance parameters, which reduces to REML when estimating
covariances in normal linear models. Again this is not generally equivalent to our
conditional likelihood but, because it produces unbiased estimating equations, may
approximate our approach in large samples.</p>
