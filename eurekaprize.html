<h2>limma software for differential analysis of omics data</h2>

<p>
limma is the world's most downloaded R software package for statistical analysis of omics data and has been cited in 75,000 research papers.
Professor Smyth created the package and has maintained and developed it for over 20 years with help from students and postdocs in his Lab.
</p>


<h2>Non-technical summary</h2>

<p>
R is the world's most used statistical programming language and limma is the world's most downloaded R software package for statistical analysis of genomic and proteomics data.
</p>

<p>
limma uses detects changes in gene activity in disease states or cell types or developmental stages. Understanding such changes is fundamental to understanding the molecular basis of human biology and for understanding how diseases arise. Such understanding lays the foundation to create drugs or treatments to cure those diseases.
</p>

<p>
limma "borrows" statistical information between genes to achieve reliable conclusions even the number of cases of small. It handles complicated experiments and adjusts for other experimental factors.
</p>

<p>
limma has been used to make scientific discoveries in over 70,000 published papers.
