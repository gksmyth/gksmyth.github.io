<h2>Using the Library</h2>

<p>OzDASL is a library of data sets and associated stories. It is intended as a resource
for teachers of statistics in Australia and New Zealand and elsewhere.
Emphasis is given to data sets with an Australasian context,
although interesting data sets from anywhere in the world are included.</p>

<p>Data sets are grouped by the most obvious applicable methodology.&nbsp; However these
are not exclusive. For example, data sets with several variables can often be used for
simple linear regression as well as for multiple regression, and almost any variable
provides an example of a single sample.</p>

<p>Methods are listed from simple to advance, in much the same order as they would be
introduced in a statistics course. Even within methods, data sets are listed in order of
size and complexity, from simple to advanced. </p>

<p>You may browse for data sets under the following headings:

<ul>
  <li><a href="first.html"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">First
  Course in Statistics</font></strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="multiple.html"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">Multiple
  Regression and Multifactor ANOVA</font></strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="glm.html"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">Nonlinear
  Regression and Generalized Linear Models</font></strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="timeseri.html"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">Time
  Series</font></strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="advanced.html"><strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">More
  Advanced Methods</font></strong></a></li>
</ul>
