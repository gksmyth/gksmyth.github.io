<h1>Age and Memory</h1>

<p>Keywords: Balanced two-way analysis of variance, interaction.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Why do older people often seem not to remember things as well as younger
people? Do they not pay attention? Do they just not process the material as
thoroughly? One theory regarding memory is that verbal material is remembered as
a function of the degree to which is was processed when it was initially
presented. Eysenck (1974) randomly assigned 50 younger subjects and 50 older
(between 55 and 65 years old) to one of five learning groups. The Counting group
was asked to read through a list of words and count the number of letters in
each word. This involved the lowest level of processing. The Rhyming group was
asked to read each word and think of a word that rhymed with it. The Adjective
group was asked to give an adjective that could reasonably be used to modify
each word in the list. The Imagery group was instructed to form vivid images of
each word, and this was assumed to require the deepest level of processing. None
of these four groups was told they would later be asked to recall the items.
Finally, the Intentional group was asked to memorize the words for later recall.
After the subjects had gone through the list of 27 items three times they were
asked to write down all the words they could remember.</p>
