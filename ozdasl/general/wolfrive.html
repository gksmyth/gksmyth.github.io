<h1>Wolf River Pollution</h1>

<p>Keywords: correlation, one-way analysis of variance, outliers, analysis of covariance</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Jaffe, Parker and Wilson have investigated the concentration of several hydrophobic
organic substances (such as hexachlorobenzene, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin, dieldrin,
endrin) in the Wolf River in Tennessee. Measurements were taken downstream of an abandoned
dump site that had previously been used by the pesticide industry to dispose of its waste
products.</p>

<p>It was expected that these hydrophic substances might have a nonhomogeneous vertical
distribution in the river because of differences in density between these compounds and
water and because of the adsorption of these compounds on sediments, which could lead to
higher concentrations on the bottom. It is important to check this hypothesis because the
standard procedure of sampling at six-tenths of the depth could miss the bulk of these
pollutants if the distribution were not uniform.</p>

<p>Grab samples were taken with a La Motte-Vandorn water sampler of 1 litre capacity at
various depths of the river. This sampler consists of a horizontal plexiglas tube of 7
centimetres diameter and a plunger of each side which shuts the sampler when the sampler
is at the desired depth. Ten surface, 10 mid-depth and 10 bottom samples were collected,
all within a relatively short period. Until they were analysed the samples were stored in
1-quart mason jars at low temperature.</p>

<p>In the analysis of the samples, a 250-millilitre water sample was taken from each mason
jar and was extracted with 1 millilitre of either hexanes or petroleum ether. A sample of
the extract was then injected into a gas chromatograph and the output was compared against
standards of known concentrations. The test procedure was repeated two more times,
injecting different samples of the extract in the gas chromatograph. The average aldrin
and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) concentrations (in nanograms per liter) in these 30 samples
are given in the data.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There are 3 apparent outliers.</li>
  <li>Aldrin concentration does increase with depth. HCB may do also, but the effect is not
    significant.</li>
</ul>
