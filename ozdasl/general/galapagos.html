<h1>Gal&aacute;pagos Island Species Data</h1>

<p>Keywords: binomial regression, transformation</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Gal&aacute;pagos Islands about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador provide an
excellent laboratory for studying the factors that influence the development and
survival of different life species. They were the site of much of Charles
Darwin&#8217;s original research leading later to publication of his &#8220;Origin of
Species&#8221;. Descending from a few stranded ancestors and cut off from the rest of
the world, the Gal&aacute;pagos animals offer much more obvious proofs of the fact of
evolution than can be seen in the more intricate complexities of life in most
environments. Darwin wrote </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"><i>The natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and well deserves
attention. Most of the organic productions are aboriginal creations, found
nowhere else; there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the
different islands; yet all show a marked relationship with those of America,
though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and
600 miles in width. The archipelago is a little world in itself, or rather a
satellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few stray colonists and
has received the general character of its indigenous productions. Considering
the small size of the islands, we feel the more astonished at the number of
their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range. Seeing every height
crowned with its crater, and the boundaries of most of the lava-streams still
distinct, we are led to believe that within a period geologically recent the
unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be
brought somewhere near to that great fact---that mystery of mysteries---the
first appearance of new beings on earth.</i></p>
<p>And from elsewhere in Darwin's diary:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"><i>I never dreamed that islands 50
or 60 miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely
the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal
height, would have been differently tenanted &#8230; It is the circumstance that
several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise,
mocking-thrush, finches and numerous plants, these species having the same
general habits, occupying analogous situations, and obviously filling the same
place in the natural economy of the archipelago, that strikes me with wonder.</i></p>
<p>Johnson and Raven (1973) presented data giving
the number of plant species and related variables for 29 different islands.
Counts are given for both the total number of species and the number of species
that occur only in the Gal&aacute;pagos (i.e., are endemic to the Gal&aacute;pagos). </p>
