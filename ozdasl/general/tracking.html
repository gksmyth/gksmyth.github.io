<h1>Rotary Pursuit Tracking</h1>

<p>Keywords: repeated measures, three-way analysis of variance, non-parametric regression</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>&quot;Discovery Day&quot; is a day set aside by the United States Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey, California, to invite the general public into its laboratories. On
Discovery Day, 21 October 1995, data on reaction time and hand-eye coordination were
collected on 118 members of the public who visited the Human Systems Integration Laboratory. The age and sex of each subject were also recorded. Visitors were mostly in family groups.</p>

<p>One experiment which demonstrates motor learning and hand-eye coordination, is rotary
pursuit tracking. The equipment used has a rotating disk with a 3/4&quot; target spot. The
subject&#146;s task is to maintain contact with the target spot with a metal wand. Trials
were conducted for 15 seconds at a time, and the total contact time during the 15 seconds
was recorded. Four trials were recorded for each of 108 subjects. </p>

<p>The target spot on the Circle tracker keeps constant speed in a circular path. The
target spot on the Box tracker has varying speeds as it traverses the box, making the task
potentially more difficult. </p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>There was a marked learning pattern across the four trials. In general, the older the
subject the better they did, but the oldest subjects had difficulty with the box tracker.</p>

<p>One can use this as an example of two-way or three-way analysis of variance and interaction by
grouping age into categories and predicting the mean time for the four trials.</p>
