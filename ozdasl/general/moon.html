<h1>The Moon Illusion</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Why does the moon appear to be so much larger when it is near the horizon
than when it is directly overhead? This question has produced a wide variety of
theories from psychologists. An important early hypothesis was put forth by
Holway and Boring (1940) who suggested that the illusion was due to the fact
that when the moon was on the horizon, the observer looked straight at it with
eyes level, whereas when it was at its zenith, the observer had to elevate his
or her eyes as well as his or her head to see it. To test this hypothesis,
Kaufman and Rock (1962) devised an apparatus that allowed them to present two
artificial moons, one at the horizon and one at the zenith, and to control
whether the subjects elevated their eyes or kept them level to see the zenith
moon. The horizon, or comparison, moon was always viewed with eyes level.
Subjects were asked to adjust the variable horizon moon to match the size of the
zenith moon or vice versa. For each subject the ratio of the perceived size of
the horizon moon to the perceived size of the zenith moon was recorded with eyes
elevated and with eyes level. A ratio of 1.00 would represent no illusion. If
Holway and Boring were correct, there should be a greater illusion in the
eyes-elevated condition than in the eyes-level condition.</p>
