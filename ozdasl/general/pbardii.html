<h1>Circadian Rhythms in the Prairie Deer Mouse</h1>

<p>Keywords: time series, periodicities, outliers</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data are temperature recordings made at 5 minute intervals over 3 months on a
nocturnal mammal, <em>Peromyscus bardii</em> (prairie deer mouse). The animal was given 20
days of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark as an adjustment period, followed by 10 days of
constant dark, 12 hours light and 26 days constant dark.</p>

<p>The data was collected at Princeton University in the late 1960's under the direction
of Dr C. S. Pittendrich. The interest of the researchers was to observe periodicities in
the behaviour of the animals. Four experiments were completed over a period of several
years. The experiments used equipment to isolate each animal from its external environment
as completely as possible, a telemetry system to transmit animal body temperate and an
activity sensor in the floor of each cage. The telemetry system consisted of a small
temperature transmitter implanted in each animal and a receiver and data logging system.
Each experiment used 17 animals of the same species isolated in 17 separate cages, with an
18th cage containing only a temperature transmitter in order to monitor the environment.
Each cage contained a light source so that the photoperiod for each animal could be
varied.</p>

<p>The data given here are the telemeter frequency temperature recordings for one animal
from the first experiment, with higher counts indicating higher temperature. Since the
interest was in periodicity, no effort was made to relate the telemeter frequency to
actual temperature.</p>

<p>The data file contains 33983 observations. Since recordings were made at 5 minute
intervals, this is one observation short of 118 days, rather more than the 56.5 days that
there should nominally be. Presumably the extra days were also in darkness.</p>

<p>Various problems arose during the experiments, including transient or permanent
equipment failure or death of the animals. About half of the cages continued to produce
data through to the end of the experiment. The data logging equipment was also imperfect,
as it was based on a conversion to mechanical keypunch operation. Readings were punched in
fields on standard 80 column cards. Some card punch problems, such as jams and misfeeds,
were corrected during the experiment. Other malfunctions became evident during data
analysis, namely mispunched data (non-numeric or out-of-range) or column shift (all data
shifted left by some number of columns). In the data presented here, obvious errors have
been corrected, but a proportion of outliers and other errors remain. There are some
sequences of zeros, which correspond presumably to temporary failures of the recording
equipment. </p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The data show daily periodicities. There are also apparent outliers, including extended
sequences of zeros, and a substantial change in magnitude after 30 days. The plot shows
the data from days 31 to 40, including some possible outliers.</p>
