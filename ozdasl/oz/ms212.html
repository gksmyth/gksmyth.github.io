<h1>Pulse Rates before and after Exercise</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Students in an introductory statistics class (MS212 taught by Professor John
Eccleston and Dr Richard
Wilson at The University of Queensland) participated in a simple experiment. The
students took their own pulse rate. They were then asked to flip a coin. If the
coin came up heads, they were to run in place for one minute. Otherwise they sat
for one minute. Then everyone took their pulse again. The pulse rates and other
physiological and lifestyle data are given in the data.</p>

<p> Five class groups between
1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. The lecturer, Richard Wilson, was
concerned that some students would choose the less strenuous option of sitting
rather than running even if their coin came up heads, so in the years 1995-1998 a
different method of random assignment was used. In these years, data forms were handed out to the class before the experiment. The
forms were pre-assigned to either running or non-running and there were an equal number of
each. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned so the numbers running
and sitting was still not entirely controlled.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The paired comparison between Pulse1 and Pulse2 should depend heavy on
    Ran.</li>
  <li>Is there evidence that some students didn't run even though their coin
    toss came up heads?</li>
  <li>How does Pulse1 depend on the lifestyle and physiological measurements?
    Are frequent exercisers fitter?</li>
  <li>How does the Pulse2-Pulse1 difference depend on lifestyle and
    physiological measurements? Do frequent exercisers run more energetically?</li>
  <li>Is there discernable differences between the years?</li>
</ul>
