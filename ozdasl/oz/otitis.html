<h1>Prevalence of Otitis Media in Aboriginal Communities</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National Trachoma and Eye Health Program (1980) reports on the
prevalance of <em>otitis media</em> (an infection that produces pus within the middle ear)
in both aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities in Australia. The Program surveyed all
aboriginal communities in Australia and attempted to contact all aborigines.
Simultaneously, contact was made with non-aborigines usually living in the same or
adjacent locations. Because of the high prevalence of infection in the aboriginal
community only severe cases were classified as infected, virtually all of them suffering
bursting of the ear drum and consequent scarring. It was thought that scarring could be
used to identify those people who previously had had sever infections, but were not
currently infected. So it was possible to classify subjects as (a) either not currently
infected and no scarring, (b) currently infected or (c) not currently infected but one or
more drums scarred. The data give the number of aborigines examined in various age
intervals and the proportions classified as (a), (b) or (c).</p>
