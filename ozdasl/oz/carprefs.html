<h1>Car Preferences</h1>

<p>Keywords: survey, contingency table, ordinal response</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These data were collected as part of a project for the Federal Office for
Road Safety conducted by the Research Institute of Gender and Health at the
University of Newcastle. There is evidence that women drivers who are involved
in motor vehicle accidents are more likely than men to be injured. A
possible reason is that women often drive smaller cars that provide less
protection in a collision. One of the aims of the project was to examine preferences for cars among men
and women and investigate the extent to which safety was a factor in determining
preferences. </p>
<p>The survey was conducted by research assistants who asked people in car parks
to participate and administered a <a href="carprefs.pdf">structured questionnaire</a><img border="0" src="../../images/pdf.gif" width="16" height="16">. They
were instructed to obtain data from men and women with small, medium and large
cars, with 50 people per group for a total of 300 respondents. (The sample size
was based on power requirements for another part of the survey that involved
anthropometric measurements.) The research assistants approached people in car parks of the
University of Newcastle and nearby shopping centres during December 1997 and
January 1998.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The data consist of 300 records each with 22 variables.
The variables are:</p>
