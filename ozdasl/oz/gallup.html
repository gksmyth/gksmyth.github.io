<h1>Morgan Gallup Poll on Unemployment</h1>

<p>Keywords: comparing proportions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The following information was dropped in mail boxes in St Lucia, Brisbane, during June
1998 by Roy Morgan Research to advertise the Morgan Gallup Poll:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>More Australians expect Unemployment to rise rather<br>
  than fall in the New Year but most believe their job is safe.</strong></p>
  <p>More Australians expect unemployment to increase (45%, down 2% since July 1997) than to
  fall (26%, up 1%) in the next 12 months, while 29% (up 1%) expect there will be no change
  in unemployment or they can't say, the Morgan Gallup Poll finds.</p>
  <p>More than three-quarters (77%, up 4%) of Australians who work full or part-time believe
  their present job is safe, while 21% (down 3%) believe there is a chance they may become
  unemployed and 2% (down 1%) couldn't say.</p>
  <p>The majority (58%, up 6%) of workers feel that if they were to become unemployed they
  would be able to find a new job fairly quickly. Slightly over a third (36%, down 6%) think
  it might take longer and 6% (unchanged) either wouldn't look for a new job or couldn't
  say.</p>
  <p>These findings come from a special Morgan Gallup Poll on employment in the year ahead,
  conducted throughout Australia on November 12/13, 1997. A cross-section of 631 mean and
  women aged 14 or over were interviewed Australia-wide by telephone.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Assuming that the July 1997 survey was the same size as the November survey, is there
any evidence of a change in opinion in Australia between July and November 1997?</p>

<p>Based on the size of the November survey, can we be confident more Australians expect
unemployment to rise that to fall (i.e., is 45% versus 26% good evidence)?</p>

<p>Can we be confident that a most Australians think they could find a new job quickly if
necessary (i.e., is 58% of the survey enough to establish a majority in the population)?</p>
