<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This experiment was conducted by Kim Horsfall, Sue Hall and Simone Golik, statistics
students at the Queensland University of Technology in a subject taught by Dr Margaret
Mackisack. The students designed and conducted an experiment to determine the factors
affecting the time to swim one lap of a 25m pool.</p>

<p>The experiment was inspired by the subtropical climate of Brisbane, which makes
swimming a popular activity to experiment with in late Spring. (The swimming pool is also
immediately adjacent to the building which houses the School of Mathematics.) The students
who carried out one swimming experiment used a friend to actually do the swimming,
measuring her time to swim one lap as the response, and included as additional information
in their report a note from the swimmer explaining her view of the experience: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>``The first thing I remember is trying to concentrate on a set rhythm more than
  anything else as I was looking to keep the lap times as consistent as possible. On the
  first lap I shot out of the gate and suddenly realised that I would be doing a number of
  laps and I needed to concentrate on rhythm rather than speed. As the laps continued I
  slowly began to realise that I was getting more tired. At about lap 20 I took a break for
  a couple of minutes as I felt that I had reached the stage where it would begin to affect
  the lap times. </p>
  <p>``When I was swimming without the goggles I found it more difficult to swim straight
  and would occasionally bump into things (lane rope, people). It mostly felt as thought I
  was going slower when swimming from the shallow to the deep end. After taking the flippers
  off, the first few kick beats felt funny.'' </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armed with this information, and the data about order of runs and which end of the pool
they were made from, students can be asked to consider revising the design of the
experiment, taking the end of pool into account and possibly breaking the runs up into
blocks to minimise the tiredness effect. The role of serial correlation can be
investigated, and the effect of incorporating time as an extra covariate. </p>
