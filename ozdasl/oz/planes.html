<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data was collected by Stewart Fischer and David Tippetts, statistics students at the
Queensland University of Technology in a subject taught by Dr Margaret Mackisack. Here is
their description of the data and its collection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The experiment decided upon was to see if by using two different designs of
  paper aeroplane, how far the plane would travel. In considering this, the
  question arose, whether different types of paper and different angles of
  release would have any effect on the distance travelled. Knowing that paper
  aeroplanes are greatly influenced by wind, we had to find a way to eliminate
  this factor. We decided to perform the experiment in a hallway of the
  University, where the effects of wind can be controlled to some extent by
  closing doors.</p>
  <p>In order to make the experimental units as homogeneous as possible we
  allocated one person to a task, so person 1 folded and threw all planes,
  person 2 calculated the random order assignment, measured all the distances,
  checked that the angles of flight were right, and checked that the plane
  release was the same each time.</p>
  <p>The factors that we considered each had two levels as follows:</p>
  <p>Paper: A4 size, 80gms and 50gms<br>
  Design: High Performance Dual Glider, and Incredibly Simple Glider (patterns
  attached to original report)<br>
  Angle of release: Horizontal, or 45 degrees upward.</p>
  <p>The random order assignment was calculated using the random number function
  of a calculator. Each combination of factors was assigned a number from one to
  eight, the random numbers were generated and accordingly the order of the
  experiment was found.</p>
