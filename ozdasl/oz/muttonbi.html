<h1>Growth of Tasmanian Muttonbirds</h1>

<p>Keywords: Jagged growth curve, storage model</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Following the Second World War, D. L. Serventy
carried out a detailed study of the lifecycle of the <a href="http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/wildlife/birds/muttbird.html">Tasmanian
muttonbird</a> (<em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>, often called the
short-tailed shearwater). The data here concerns the growth
pattern of fledgling birds of this species.</p>

<p>After the eggs hatch, the parent birds spend much
time away from the next, and with increasing time their returns
become rarer and rarer. When they return the young bird feed
copiously, and there is very rapid weight-gain; whilst they are
absent, the offspring loses weight. The result is not a smooth
growth curve such as one finds in most measurements in developing
animals and birds, but a 'sawtooth' effect. The data were collected
in 1954 as weighings each morning of two fledgling
chicks on Fisher Island, Bass Strait, and each set terminates on
the day the chick left the nest.</p>

<p>Much of the interest in these curves comes not
from the description they give of the weight of the chick, but
from the information they contain on the feeding patterns of the
parents. There are three obvious features of the data; the timing
of the feeds and the size of the feeds when they occur, both of
which represent aspects of the feeding pattern of the parents;
and the loss in weight of the chicks between feeds. Henstridge
and Tweedie (1984) proposed a model, similar to those used in
storage theory, which describes each of these phenomena
separately.</p>
