<h1>Alcohol, Hypertension and Obesity</h1>

<p>Keywords: Contingency Tables</p>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data comes from a small study in Western Australia of hypertension, alcohol, and
obesity. This study was partly designed to mimic a previously reported U.S. study based on a
larger sample.  A log-linear interaction model is a convenient and effective way of
investigating associations among the three variables.  A prior-posterior analysis of this 3 x 2
x 4 contingency table using prior information from the previous study (Klatsky et al., 1977)
may be appropriate.  The previous study reported the general conclusion that alcohol intake and
obesity were significantly and independently associated with hypertension (blood pressure).
Although a few summary statistics were reported, the full data were not published.  One
difference between the two studies was in the definition of obesity categories.<p>

<p>The data is listed as follows: the first column (Obesity) contains a numerical value
representing the level of obesity (1=low, 2=average, 3=high), the second column (BP) contains
a numerical indicator of the presence of hypertension (0=no, 1 =yes). The next five
columns are labelled with the levels of alcoholic intake of the subjects, in drinks per day.
These columns contain the frequency of observations that have this level of intake, for
each group of obesity level and hypertension presence.</p>
