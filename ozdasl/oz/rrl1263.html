<h1>Magnitudes of Variable Star RR Lyrae 1263</h1>

<p>Keywords: time series, sinusoid signal, discrete spectra, outliers</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data gives observations on the magnitude of a RR Lyrae variable star made from the
Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra in Australia. Magnitudes were recorded separately
for the blue and red bands. Observation times were irregularly spaced depending on sky
conditions and the observation schedule. The observations were made as part of the <a href="http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/">MACHO project</a>. This particular star is RRc Lyrae
star number 1263, a category 1 star with a symmetric signal.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The MACHO project monitors millions of stars every night with a dedicated telescope at
Mount Stromlo Observatory. The collaboration is probing the halo of our galaxy in order to
detect dark matter in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects <font face="Symbol">-</font>
MACHOs. These are astronomical bodies that emit negligible visible light, such as dwarf or
neutron stars, large planets, and black holes. Detection of a MACHO is achieved by
observing its gravitational lensing effect on a chance background star as the MACHO
crosses near the line of sight between the observer and this star. In order to detect a
sufficiently large number of MACHOs, the project collects observations on an large number
of distant stars over an extended period of time. Data are being collected daily over a
4-year period (weather permitting), on approximately 8 million stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the bulge of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>This database is a valuable resource for many other types of astronomical research. It
is the most comprehensive catalog of stars in the LMC and contains stars much dimmer than
those covered by previous surveys. Temporal coverage is unusually long compared to most
star surveys, which permits a comprehensive study of star variability, including long
periods and transient phenomena. About 40,000 variable stars have been observed in the LMC
and a similar number in the galactic bulge. </p>

<p>Variable stars are stars for which the intensity of the emitted energy changes over
time; for periodic variable stars the change of intensity is periodic over time. Common
types of periodic variable stars include eclipsing binaries, RR Lyraes, and Cepheids. RR
Lyrae stars have periods in the range 0.2 to 0.9 days. The brightness changes is caused by
periodic pulsation (contraction and expansion) of the stars and their outer layers. There
are two common types, RRab stars which have an asymmetric signal and RRc stars which have
a symmetric signal.</p>

<p>There are numerous additional types of variable stars, and each of the categories above
contains subcategories. For example, Beat Cepheids and Beat RR Lyrae oscillate at more
than one frequency. Different classes of variable stars can be located in different
regions of a plot of magnitude versus temperature or spectral type. For example, RR Lyraes
and Cepheids lie on a strip called the &quot;instability strip.&quot; Different types of
variable curves are classified also on the basis of the shapes of their light curves and
the relationships of shapes to period, for example. As well as being important for studies
of stellar structure and evolution, these classes are used to determine distances on a
cosmic scale by means of the relationship of their periods to their magnitudes.</p>

<p>Observations of these stars are typically made at rather irregular times, depending on
observation schedules and sky conditions. Different observations have differing errors.
All this makes determination of the periods and the shapes of the corresponding phased
light curves an interesting statistical problem.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>An ordinary time series plot of the data appears to show no pattern, even excluding the
many outliers. However the star has a period of about 0.33 days (which is much less than
the average interval between observations). Here is the data in the blue band wrapped
around the period, with the best fitting sinusoid curve superimposed. The sinosoid signal
was fitted using the mmfreq function to allow for the outliers.</p>
