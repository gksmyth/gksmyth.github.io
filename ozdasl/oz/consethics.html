<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The introduction of the Euro moves the European Union one step closer to
becoming a truly &#8220;single&#8221; market. However almost daily there are issues
discussed in the popular press, that brings into question the homogeneity of
this market. One of the major motivations of the European Union was to enable
expansions of trade amongst member countries. The premise that there are
corporate benefits to the European Union has as an implicit assumption that
consumers within the member countries behave in the same or similar way. This
paper uses Muncy and Vitell&#8217;s (1992) Consumer Ethics Scale (CES) to examine
whether there are differences between consumers in Northern and Southern EU
countries. </p>
<h3>Consumer Focus </h3>
<p>The CES was developed over several years using a range of items that was
refined, reduced and validated to consist of 18 item examining a range of
&#8220;questionable&#8221; consumer behaviours in relation to their dealing with firms (Al-Khatib
et al. 1996). These items identified that there were four distance constructs or
categories of ethically questionable consumer behaviour, which they labelled as:
Actively Benefiting From Illegal Activity; 2) Passively Benefiting; 3) Actively
Benefiting From Questionable Action; and 4) No Harm/No Foul. </p>
<p>The CES has been applied in a range of single country and cross-cultural
studies. However, none of the comparative works examine attitudes within one
trading block or market, such as the EU, NAFTA or CIS. It might be assumed that
countries within such trading blocks should possibly be more similar than
countries in markets that are not formally &quot;integrated&quot;. If any differences were
found, the examination of ethical values would be even more pertinent to
organisations operating within these regions, as they would be operating within
a heterogeneous &#8220;unified&#8221; market. </p>
<h3>North/South Rationale </h3>
<p>For the EU to operate as one market it needs to undergo a process of cultural
change, such that there is a common identity as well as a common market (Moller
1993, Seed 1993). Such perspective seems to be a utopian ideal, ignoring the
realities of &#8220;combining&#8221; independent states who have different political
traditions, histories (even though they are often related), cultures, and in
some cases even values (Bohata 1997). </p>
<p>When thinking about differences in today&#8217;s Europe, many firstly think of the
problems associated with joining countries that have developed under
capitalistic markets, i.e. Western Europe, and those that have evolved under a
controlled system, i.e. Eastern Europe (Anonymous 1993, Ballew and Schnorbus
1993, Dale 1995). However, if one considers the level of development within
countries their may also be a north &#8211; south division, which could also influence
consumer&#8217;s ethical behaviour (Wood 1995, Van Luijk 1997, Rossouw 1994) Priem et
al (1998). </p>
<p>While Southern EU countries are not traditional considered to be &#8220;developing
nations,&quot; there are differences across various socio-economic characteristics.
That is, Southern countries generally have; lower population growth rates, lower
per capita income; fewer years of schooling, higher infant mortality rates and
lower proportions of their population live in urban areas. All of these factors,
other than lower population growth suggests that Southern EU countries are
&#8220;less&#8221; developed than their Northern neighbors. </p>
<h3>The Sample </h3>
<p>The focus of the study is to examine the hypothesis that consumers in
Southern and Northern regions of the EU have similar views towards what could be
considered permissible or unacceptable consumer behaviour. The data used in this
study was collected from regionally balanced sample of business students in 8 EU
countries, four from Southern EU countries - Italy, Portugal Greece and Spain -
and four from Northern EU countries - Scotland, Denmark, The Netherlands and
Germany. </p>
<p>The CES instrument was translated and back translated as required to ensure
consistency. The CES questionnaire was a self-administrated questionnaire to
undergraduate students from each of the countries, there were 962 respondents in
total. The sample is regionally balanced with approximately 50% of respondents
from each region. The distribution of ages (mean 20.7 years) and gender (52.8%
male) is not statistically different within regions or across regions. Overall
there was an 8.1% non-response rate and 2% of the questionnaires were excluded
from analysis because they were incomplete, resulting in an effective response
rate of 89.9%. </p>
