<h1>Air Safety</h1>

<p>Keywords: independent events, binomial probability</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Publicity given recently to several serious safety incidents on Qantas flights has lead
to a renewed interest in air safety statistics. The article <em>Fasten Seatbelts</em> by
Neale Maynard on pages 21-22 of the Courier Mail, April 29, 2000, read</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to aircraft manufacturer Boeing, serious accidents are exceedingly rare in
  the jet age.</p>
  <p>&quot;The risk of being involved in a commercial jet aircraft accident where there are
  multiple fatalities is approximately one in 3 million. To put this in perspective, you'd
  have to fly once every day for more than 8200 years to accumulate 3 million flights,&quot;
  Boeing says.</p>
  <p>University of Queensland statistician and senior lecturer in mathematics, Dr Gordon
  Smyth, says that based on Boeing's figures, a passenger would have a 37 percent chance of
  going for 3 million flights without being involved in a multiple fatality accident.</p>
  <p>&quot;That means the probability is slightly more than 50:50 that you would have an
  accident in 3 million flights,&quot; Smyth&nbsp; says.</p>
  <p>Increase your travel tally to 6 million flights and Smyth says the odds of avoiding a
  multiple fatality crash worsen to 14 percent, and fall to just 5 percent for 9 million
  flights.</p>
  <p>&quot;You've got a smaller and smaller probability of going more and more flights
  without an accident,&quot; Smyth says, conceding that increased safety is a variable which
  will improve a passenger's odds.</p>
  <p>He says that if Boeing's figures are translated to a more achievable number of flights,
  such as the number of flights taken by a flight attendant flying four times a day for 230
  days a year over 30 years, the probability of being involved in a fatal crash would be 1
  percent.</p>
  <p>But he points out that just because the statistics suggest the likelihood of an
  accident within a certain number of flights, that does not mean that an accident will
  occur.</p>
  <p>On the Qantas issue, Smyth says that establishing whether the airline is now
  statistically more likely to face a serious accident than it was previously would be a
  major statistical exercise and, in any event, chance could also play a part.</p>
  <p>The Rome and Bangkok incidents, could, potentially, be a chance cluster, he explains.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's always possible to get more accidents or fewer accidents, regardless of what
  the safety standards are,&quot; Smyth says.</p>
