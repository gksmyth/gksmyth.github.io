<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data was collected as part of the Australian bovine tuberculosis
eradication campaign. Suitably treated bovine tissue was placed on culture
plates and examined for the growth of colonies of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>.
Material for culture was decontaminated prior to inoculation onto culture media.
The data describe number of <i>M. bovis </i>colonies found on culture plates at
stationarity (about 12 weeks after inoculation) when 1-hexadecylpyridium
chloride (HPC) decontaminant was applied in varying
concentrations. It is of interest to find the highest possible HPC concentration
which does not kill too many <i>M. bovis</i> colonies.</p>

<p>Trajstman (1989) described the background to the problem as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)
  Division of Animal Health diagnostic procedures are being developed that will
  eventually lead to the formulation of a standard approach for the conduct of
  the Australian bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign. In particular,
  interest lies in recommending laboratory procedures for the primary isolation
  of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis</i>) from bovine lesions ....
  Typically the procedure involves placing suitably treated bovine tissues on
  culture plates and waiting to see whether <i>M. bovis</i> colonies appear. <i>M.
  bovis</i> is a slow growing bacterium and because of this slow growth it is
  possible for contaminating bacteria to overgrow the cultures. To prevent this,
  material for culture is decontaminated before inoculation on to culture media.
  Decontaminants work by killing the contaminating organisms. Unfortunately
  decontaminants can also kill the organism of interest, <i>M. bovis</i>. If the
  decontaminant is too concentrated there will be no contamination but also
  there will be so surviving <i>M. bovis</i>. However, if the decontaminant is
  not sufficiently concentrated then <i>M. bovis</i> will grow well and so will
  the contaminating organisms. The problem is to select a decontaminant at an
  appropriate concentration that leaves a many as possible culture tubes
  uncontaminated while at the same time kills as few as possible <i>M. bovis</i>
  organisms.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are two subtleties to the data which are described by Trasjstman
(1989). The first is that the maximum number of colonies at stationarity is
essentially determined by the initial number of <i>M. bovis</i> colony forming
units placed on a plate. The exact number of units placed on each plate is
unknown, but technicians attempt to place about 50 units on each plate used in
the experiment. The second is that HPC has a detergent action. At larger
concentrations it may lead to a slight over-counting of the number of colonies
by dispersing larger colonies into smaller clumps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Both Trajstram (1989) and Morgan (1992) treated observation 61 as an outlier.
Trasjstram (1989) treated the counts as binomial with unknown n, while Morgan
(1992) treated the data as overdispersed Poisson.</p>

<p>This data is interesting because it is highly overdispersed relative to Poisson, but still appears to have a linear mean-variance relationship.
In particular the data clearly is not negative binomial. </p>
