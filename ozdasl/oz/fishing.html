<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data was collected by Peter Drew and Matt Seidemann, statistics students at the
Queensland University of Technology, in a subject taught by Dr Margaret Mackisack. Here is
their description of the data and its collection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;As keen fishermen out and about on a fairly regular basis, the common arguments
  arise between anglers on the best rigging set up for various conditions. We decided that
  upon our next group outing that we would back up our opinions with hard statistical facts.
  Our interest led us to test the most obvious variables in the fishing rig. </p>
  <p>&quot;Of interest were firstly the rod length, as between fisherman there always tends
  to be a variety of rods of different sizes; secondly the type of line, in that the larger
  the line it would be logical that the weight would increase; thirdly the sinker weight and
  how it affected the casting distance. </p>
  <p>&quot;In deciding on the three variables a 2^3 factorial design seemed obvious and for
  our purposes seemed to be quite adequate. So the question was placed as to whether or not
  the above variables in any combination made any difference to the overall distance the
  line was cast. The rods used were 6ft and 7ft two piece boat rods, fitted with the same
  type of spinning reel. The variable sinkers were 8oz and 12oz round ball sinkers and the
  line used was either the 1kg or 2kg line of the same make. </p>
  <p>&quot;The experiment was carried out on a day that was close to windless thus lowering
  the relative influence of the wind. The series of casts was conducted by the same person
  as were the measurements thus giving uniformity to the total experiment. A break of five
  minutes was timed between casts so as to allow the caster to allocate the same amount of
  energy to each cast. The rods were not rigged by the caster; a rigger would set the rod up
  with a combination of sinker, line and rod, and an effort was made to keep the caster
  oblivious to the changes in the rig. </p>
  <p>&quot;The experiment was conducted on the rugby ovals on Oleria St, Brookside (a western surburb of Brisbane) adjacent
  to the RSL (Returned Serviceman League club), which for all intents and purposes would be classified as a level surface. A
  line was placed at one end of the field and from it the caster would cast the rod as he
  would given normal fishing conditions. A spotter who was also the measurer would mark the
  point of impact of the sinker and from it measure back to the line from which it was cast.
  The distance observed was subsequently rounded up to the nearest 0.5 of a metre. Two runs
  were made of each combination. </p>
  <p>&quot;Possible improvements: Because of the time the rigging took, both casts with each
  rig were done at the same time. If we did it again it would be better to use random
  numbers to decide the order of all sixteen casts.&quot; </p>

<p>There is a big difference between the two rods (37.625m vs 32.75m average cast for 7ft
and 6ft rods), and a similar difference between sinkers, casting further with heavier
sinker. There is also a considerable interaction between the sinker weight and line
weight, the best casts being made with heavy sinker and lighter line, and the worst casts
with the light sinker on the light line, as summarized in the following table. </p>
