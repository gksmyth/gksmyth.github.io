<h1>Pizza Delivery Experiment</h1>

<p>Keywords: Three-Way Analysis of Variance, Designed Experiment.</p>

<hr>

<h2><description</h2>Description</h2>

<p>Experiment conducted by Bill Afantenou, second year statistics student at QUT. Here is
his description of the experiment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>``As I am a big pizza lover, I had much pleasure in involving pizza in my experiment. I
  became curious to find out the time it took for a pizza to be delivered to the front door
  of my house. I was interested to see how, by varying whether I ordered thick or thin
  crust, whether Coke was ordered with the pizza and whether garlic bread was ordered with
  the pizza, the response would be affected. </p>
  <p>``Because of my current financial status and limitation of time, I decided to have only
  two replicates, just to get a reasonable estimate of the variance. To decrease my
  financial burden I managed a deal with the manager of the pizza shop. I managed to get the
  pickup special, delivered to my house, which was the cheapest and smallest pizza made. I
  tried to repeat the experiment in as nearly as possible identical conditions to reduce
  `noise'. </p>
  <p>``I ordered the pizza from the same shop, being Domino's Pizza. To be consistent I
  ordered a Supreme pizza each time at approximately the same time of day. The response was
  measured from the time I closed the telephone to the time the pizza was delivered to the
  front door of my house. </p>
  <p>``I wrote each of the eight treatments on a piece of paper twice, put them all into a
  hat, mixed them up, and took them out one at a time to allocate the order in which each
  treatment was done. </p>
  <p>``As well as the response and treatment for each pizza delivery the actual hour of
  delivery was recorded, also the order in which the treatments were done and whether the
  driver was male or female.'' </p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>This experiment shows interesting interactions between factors and some interesting
features in the residual plots, including the possible use of covariate information to
investigate unplanned influences on the response. </p>

<p>Delivery is quicker when a drink or garlic bread is included, because the drivers were
paid more for more items.</p>
