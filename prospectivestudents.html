<h1>For Prospective Students</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Doing a PhD in my Lab</h2>

<p>The WEHI and the Bioinformatics Division in particular provide an exciting and supportive
environment for students.</p>

<p>I regularly have openings for new students.
My Lab develops computational and statistical methods for analysing genomic and proteomics data, especially data from RNA-seq, mass spectrometry and related technologies.
Projects might include the analysis of single cell RNA-seq, or detection of splice variants, or the analysis of higher order expression signatures representing biological pathways or cell fates, or integrative analyses combining information from a number of different technologies. Projects may also include the analysis of data from emerging technologies. Projects will involve collaborations with biomedical researchers in other laboratories working on cancer or immunological diseases.
</p>

<p>These projects would suit students with a background in mathematics, statistics, genetics or computer science etc.</p>

<p>All PhD students need to win a PhD scholarship, usually through the University of Melbourne.
For more details about scholarships and about being a student at the WEHI, see
