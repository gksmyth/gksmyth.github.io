<h1>Information for Prospective Students</h1>

<h2>Doing a PhD in my Lab</h2>

<p>My expertise is in mathematical statistics, statistics computing and bioinformatics and I am based full-time at the Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI), where I am Head of the Bioinformatics Division. The WEHI provides an exciting and supportive environment for students.

<p>My Lab develops computational and statistical methods for analysing genomic and proteomics data, especially data from RNA-seq, mass spectrometry and related technologies.
My work focuses particularly on gene expression, identifying patterns of gene expression that can characterize biological processes or diseases, and on the regularly mechanisms that control gene expression.
Projects might include the analysis of single cell RNA-seq, or detection of splice variants, or the analysis of higher order expression signatures representing biological pathways or cell fates, or integrative analyses combining information from a number of different technologies. Projects may also include the analysis of data from emerging technologies. Projects will involve collaborations with biomedical researchers in other laboratories working on cancer or immunological diseases.

<p>My Lab focuses on methods development. I only accept students with strong backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, computer science or genetics equivalent to an undergraduate major in one of those subjects.
Students don't necessarily need to have any prior knowledge of biology or medicine, but they should be highly motivated to apply their mathematical and computations skills to medical problems.
I don't accept students from more generic backgrounds in bioinformatics or biology or technology. A list of my current and previous research students is given at <a href="students.html">https://gksmyth.github.io/students.html</a>.

<p>I am primarily available for PhD project supervision.
I only accept masters or honours students in special circumstances, usually where I have worked with the student previously.
Sorry, I am not generally able to accept intern students.

<p>All PhD students need to win a PhD scholarship, usually through the University of Melbourne.
For more details about scholarships and about being a student at the WEHI, see
